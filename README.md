# tyrannosaurus-trx

A trx file utility with most of the code copied from https://github.com/rndsolutions/trx-merger

The changes i've made are:

- Turning into dotnet tool
- Change the console app api
- Fixed a couple of bugs in the generator
- Changed the outputted report structure

## Installation

The cli is a `dotnet tool` and can be installed via the dotnet sdk with:

```
dotnet tool install --global TyrannosaurusTrx
```

## Usage

The cli will not run if no paths or a functionality isn't specified.

To generate a report of all of the trx files in a folder `C:/some/folder` to the path `C:/some/report.html` 

```
t-trx -p C:/some/folder -r C:/some/report.html
```

To merge all of the trx files in a folder `C:/some/folder` to the path `C:/some/merged.trx` 

```
t-trx -p C:/some/folder -m C:/some/merged.trx
```

To do all of the above recursively 

```
t-trx -p C:/some/folder -m C:/some/merged.trx -r C:/some/report.html --recurse
```

To generate a report from a single trx file to the default report name for a directory

```
t-trx -p C:/some/folder/some.trx -r C:/some
```
